# TODO

- programmatically generate all destinations
- manually generate sources for O+
- programmatically generate all sources
- show percentage labels:
  - % of population in center of each item in center color
  - % of population included & excluded for each side of center

- pick better colors (with + complimenting -)
- color the links using gradient from source to sink
- position labels ([maybe plotly isn't the best tool](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65012892/how-to-specify-node-label-position-for-sankey-diagram-in-plotly))

- source prevalence data for different countries (&/or collections of countries or regions)
