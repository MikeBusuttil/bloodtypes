# TODO

## MVP
- show percentage labels:
  - % of population in center of each item in center color
  - % of population included & excluded for each side of center
- pick better colors (with + complimenting -)
- allow showing just 1 blood type at a time (by clicking a blood type - or selecting from a drop-down)
  - should be easy to navigate back home
- verify the sizes match prevalence

## use non-plotly tool
- improve distinguishibility by centering and making adjacent visible links
- get everything visible at once
- color the links using gradient from source to sink
- position labels ([maybe plotly isn't the best tool](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65012892/how-to-specify-node-label-position-for-sankey-diagram-in-plotly))

- source prevalence data for different countries (&/or collections of countries or regions)
